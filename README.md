Comparing different voting systems.

## 1. Plurality
Plurality is probably the most simple voting system whereby a candidate who gets the most votes in the election wins. It is prevalent in the United States, where most elections are held under the plurality system. It is also used in Canada, India, the UK and many other countries.

## 2. Runoff
Runoff is relevant to me as a variant of it is used in France where I used to live. 
Plurality, as hinted by it's simplicity, has many limitations - the main one being the fact that voters can't express their true preferences. For example, if there are 3 candidates A, B and C, and a voter prefers A to B to C, but thinks that B is more likely to win than A, he might vote for B instead of A. This is called "tactical voting" and is a problem in plurality as voters' true preferences aren't always apparent. Runoff is a system that tries to solve this problem. It works as follows: if no candidate has a majority of the votes, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated and the votes are recounted. This process is repeated until a candidate has a majority of the votes. This system is used in France, where the presidential election is a runoff election between the top two candidates from the first round of voting. However, as highlighted by many in-depth scholar articles availbale online, it is still possible to manipulate Runoff voting systems.

## 3. Ranked Pairs
Ranked Pairs is a voting system that is used in the UK to elect the Speaker of the House of Commons. It is a Condorcet method, which means that if there is a candidate who is preferred to all other candidates in pairwise comparisons, that candidate will win. It works as follows: for each pair of candidates, the candidate who is preferred to the other candidate by the most voters is put in a list. The candidate who is preferred to the most other candidates is the winner. It is by far the most complicate to implement of the three voting systems I have chosen.
